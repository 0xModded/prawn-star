# This is ***Prawn Star!***, a better AutoMod for NSFW subreddits!
# What is this?
Maybe stop watching porn for 3 seconds and read the line above this. AutoMod sucks for NSFW subreddits. I made a better version :)
# Ok cool! What does it do though?
Currently it just searches for blacklisted words, then deltes the offending post and comments on it.
# Awesome! Roadmap for this?
not yet! If you have a suggestion or want to see me do something, make a pull request!
# How do I get this set up on my subreddit?
see gif below and see comments in code!
